## Comments after 10am

I decided to use Slim framework to help give a structure to the platform, 
along with Blade to provide views, 
and bootstrap for layout.

Reflecting:
 - Use different Validation
 - Better user journey
 - Update more comments (some became old in the last few hours)
 - Better 'thank you for registering'
 - Tests
 - use env()
 - Plug DB into Slim container
 -
